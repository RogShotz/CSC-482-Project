"His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch."
"In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five."
"When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium) where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative."
"The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani."
"His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial."
"While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled ""On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field"".Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior."
"At thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy, Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason."
"Kant became his favorite philosopher; according to his tutor, ""At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."""
"While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie."
"(His sister, Maja, later married Winteler's son Paul.)"
"In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship of the German Kingdom of Württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service."
"The Matura (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling) awarded to him in the September of that year acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a top grade of 6 for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry."
"In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude."
"Correspondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl."
"When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain."
"In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland."
Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910.
"In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as ""misguided"" and mourned the ""missed life"" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: ""I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."
"""In 1912, Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa Löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's."
"When Marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in April 1914, she returned to Zürich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her."
"As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would give the money that he received to Marić; she had to wait only two years before her foresight in extracting this promise from him was rewarded.Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919."
"After being widowed, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy; her husband, the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov, created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.Following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Einstein's son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia."
He spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum.
"He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one."
"Eventually it was with the help of Marcel Grossmann's father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III.Patent applications that landed on Einstein's desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter."
"His employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903, although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had ""fully mastered machine technology""."
"Einstein's first paper, ""Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"" (""Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity""), in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1900."
His 24-page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics.
"Titled ""Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen"" (""A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"") and dedicated to his friend Marcel Grossman, it was completed on 30 April 1905 and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich three months later."
"Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy—have led to the year's being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics almost as wonderful as 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies)."
"Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire."
"His teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation."
"Their invitation was all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend, Elsa Löwenthal."
"He duly joined the Academy on 24
July 1913, and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of Dahlem on 1 April 1914."
"In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere (that is, the Sun's apparent surface)."
"He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime."
"By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely)."
"In July 1921, he published an essay, ""My First Impression of the U.S.A."", in which he sought to sketch the American character, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America (1835)."
"He devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw him speaking in Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon)."
"(In a letter to his sons, he wrote that Japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest, intelligent and considerate, and to have a true appreciation of art."
"Of Chinese people, he wrote that ""even the children are spiritless and look obtuse..."
"Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner, welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute."
One reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak: he told them that he was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein's decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to Stockholm in the December of that year to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony.
"From 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries."
"By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine."
"In March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina."
"In December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology."
"During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as ""the ruling monarch of the mind""."
"Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance."
"Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration."
"During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism."
"Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a ""highly emotional temperament"", from which came his ""extraordinary intellectual energy"".Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests."
"Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as ""one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity""."
"Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his ""modest little flat"" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory."
"In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena."
"Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated."
"Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with ""virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues"", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, ""Jewish intellectualism is dead."""
"After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a ""spontaneous emotional outburst"" by those who ""shun popular enlightenment"", and ""more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence"".Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany."
"He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months."
"In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years."
"Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk."
"To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George."
"As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over ""1,000 saved individuals"".Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe."
"In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere."
"At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.Einstein was still undecided on his future."
"Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, ""regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."""
"To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered."
"In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian royal family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office."
"In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS), an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons."
"As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans."
"In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party."
"He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:

In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice."
He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.
"He wrote ""I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself."""
"He described Gandhi as ""a role model for the generations to come""."
"He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic.Einstein was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state."
The state of Israel was established without his help in 1948; Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement.
"Upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach."
"The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer ""embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons""."
"Einstein wrote that he was ""deeply moved"", but ""at once saddened and ashamed"" that he could not accept it."
He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy.
"He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve."
"For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism."
"In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish."
... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.
"Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind."
"It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."""
I get most joy in life out of music.
"His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture."
"However, he did not enjoy it at that age.When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly."
"At the age of 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas."
"Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends."
"Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others."
"He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.Einstein refused surgery, saying, ""I want to go when I want."
"He died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent."
"Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: ""He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ..."
There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.
"""Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel."
"Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski."
"The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia), Józef (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born 1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863–65)."
"This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life."
"Maria's paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski, had been principal of the Lublin primary school attended by Bolesław Prus, who became a leading figure in Polish literature.Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia (secondary schools) for boys."
"After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his children in its use."
He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.
Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.
"Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder."
"Maria's father was an atheist, her mother a devout Catholic."
The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.
"After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring."
"Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students."
"Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later."
"In connection with this, Maria took a position first as a home tutor in Warsaw, then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father."
"While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician."
"His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them."
"Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska that had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute, which she had founded in 1932.At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few months earlier had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris."
"She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again."
In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw.
"In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891."
"Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French."
"At Skłodowska's insistence, Curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School."
"He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself."
"Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge."
She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.
"This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.In 1897, her daughter Irène was born."
The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to ESPCI.
"She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium."
"Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson."
"Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: ""The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium."""
"On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar."
"They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named ""polonium"", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian)."
"The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements."
"She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris."
"In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.In June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris."
"That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to."
"Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905."
The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.
"In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, Ève."
"She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident."
"The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute."
"Elected instead was Édouard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph."
"Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife."
"When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo."
"Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing."
"Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because ""the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium"" and that ""there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life""."
"She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each."
"A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment."
"For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton."
"She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie)."
She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities.
"The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919."
"After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (""Little Curies"")."
"Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war."
"She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money."
There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns.
"Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost."
"Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States, and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife."
"Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie."
"She sat on the committee until 1934 and contributed to League of Nations' scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz, and Henri Bergson."
In 1925 she visited Poland to participate in a ceremony laying the foundations for Warsaw's Radium Institute.
"Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; the Institute opened in 1932, with her sister Bronisława its director."
"A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow.The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed."
"They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested, and speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of radiography during the First World War.She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband Pierre."
"In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935."
"His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province."
"One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname."
"Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called ""Left-Hand House"", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880–1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate."
"In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands."
"A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages."
"Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa."
"He grew up with two sisters in his mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys."
"Both his parents were illiterate, but his mother, being a devout Christian, sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven."
"Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of ""Nelson"" by his teacher."
"When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment that Mandela believed to be lung disease."
"Feeling ""cut adrift"", he later said that he inherited his father's ""proud rebelliousness"" and ""stubborn sense of fairness"".Mandela's mother took him to the ""Great Place"" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo."
"Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu."
"He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 he moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice."
"Although he had friends who held connections to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the nascent movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out."
"Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter."
"To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland."
"Mandela was widely considered a charismatic leader, described by biographer Mary Benson as ""a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people""."
"While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the ""African gentleman"", having ""the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech"" associated with such a position."
"In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became ""one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom""."
"His official biographer, Anthony Sampson, commented that he was a ""master of imagery and performance"", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites."
"Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed ""his personal commitment, charm and humour"".Mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people."
"Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as president made his own bed."
"Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour, he was known for being both stubborn and loyal, and at times exhibited a quick temper."
"Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants."
He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities.
"According to Sampson, Mandela never had ""a strong religious faith"" however, while Elleke Boehmer stated that Mandela's religious belief was ""never robust"".Mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to manhood."
"Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren."
"He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren."

"Despite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life.Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his ""great physical beauty"" and ""infinite grace,"" as described by Vasari, as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others."
"Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella."
"This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood."
Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi.
"Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate."
Isaacson in his biography of Leonardo makes explicit his opinion that the relations with Salai were intimate and homosexual.
"Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings."

"Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother)."
"Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne."
"She was delivered at 02:40 (GMT) by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London home, 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair."
"The Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May, and she was named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother."
"She was cherished by her grandfather George V, whom she affectionately called ""Grandpa England"", and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery."
"Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930."
"The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford."
"Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature, and music."
"Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family."

"His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state."
"His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless."
"Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city."
"As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as ""restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about."
"The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood."
Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family.
Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya.
"His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible."
"Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who ""would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching."
"""In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security."
"In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas."
"He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to ""Kasturba"", and affectionately to ""Ba"") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time."
"His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married."
"As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride: ""even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me."""
"He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died."
"The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad."

"On his father's side, he was a member of the British aristocracy as a direct descendant of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough."
"His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, representing the Conservative Party, had been elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Woodstock in 1874."
"His mother, Jennie, was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, a wealthy American businessman.In 1876, Churchill's paternal grandfather, John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, was appointed Viceroy of Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom."
"Winston's brother, Jack, was born there in 1880."
"Throughout much of the 1880s, Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and the brothers were mostly cared for by their nanny, Elizabeth Everest."
"When she died in 1895, Churchill wrote that ""she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived"".Churchill began boarding at St George's School in Ascot, Berkshire, at age seven but was not academic and his behaviour was poor."
His father wanted him to prepare for a military career and so his last three years at Harrow were in the army form.
"His father died in January 1895, a month after Churchill graduated from Sandhurst."
"Eager to witness military action, he used his mother's influence to get himself posted to a war zone."
"He proceeded to New York City and, in admiration of the United States, wrote to his mother about ""what an extraordinary people the Americans are!""."
"Based in Bangalore, he was in India for 19 months, visiting Calcutta three times and joining expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier.In India, Churchill began a self-education project, reading a range of authors including Plato, Edward Gibbon, Charles Darwin and Thomas Babington Macaulay."
"The books were sent to him by his mother, with whom he shared frequent correspondence when abroad."
"In order to learn about politics, he also asked his mother to send him copies of The Annual Register, the political almanac."
"In another letter to one of his cousins, he referred to religion as ""a delicious narcotic"" and expressed a preference for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism because he felt it ""a step nearer Reason"".Interested in British parliamentary affairs, he declared himself ""a Liberal in all but name"", adding that he could never endorse the Liberal Party's support for Irish home rule."
"Instead, he allied himself to the Tory democracy wing of the Conservative Party and on a visit home, gave his first public speech for the party's Primrose League at Claverton Down, near Bath."
"Mixing reformist and conservative perspectives, he supported the promotion of secular, non-denominational education while opposing women's suffrage.Churchill volunteered to join Bindon Blood's Malakand Field Force in its campaign against Mohmand rebels in the Swat Valley of north-west India."
"While campaigning in Oldham, Churchill referred to himself as ""a Conservative and a Tory Democrat""."
"After his train was derailed by Boer artillery shelling, he was captured as a prisoner of war (POW) and interned in a Boer POW camp in Pretoria."
"In December, Churchill escaped from the prison and evaded his captors by stowing away aboard freight trains and hiding in a mine."
He was among the first British troops into both places.
"He and his cousin, the Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards."
"Throughout the war, he had publicly chastised anti-Boer prejudices, calling for them to be treated with ""generosity and tolerance"", and after the war he urged the British to be magnanimous in victory."
"In the same month, he published Ian Hamilton's March, a book about his South African experiences, which became the focus of a lecture tour in November through Britain, America and Canada."
"Later, in spring 1901, he gave more lectures in Paris, Madrid and Gibraltar."
"In February 1901, Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread press coverage."
"He privately considered ""the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party"", or alternately a ""Central Party"" to unite the Conservatives and Liberals.By 1903, there was real division between Churchill and the Conservatives, largely because he opposed their promotion of economic protectionism."
Churchill sensed that the animosity of many party members would prevent him from gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government.
"The Liberal Party was then attracting growing support, and so his defection in 1904 may also have been influenced by personal ambition."
"Two months later, incensed by Churchill's criticism of the government, the Oldham Conservative Association informed him that it would not support his candidature at the next general election.In May 1904, Churchill opposed the government's proposed Aliens Bill, designed to curb Jewish migration into Britain."
"On 31 May 1904, he crossed the floor, defecting from the Conservatives to sit as a member of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons."
"Elizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of his son Randolph, who would have inherited the title on his father's death."
"Apart from 1922 to 1924, he had been an MP since October 1900 and had represented five constituencies.By the time of the 1959 general election, he seldom attended the House of Commons."
"Despite the Conservative landslide in 1959, his own majority in Woodford fell by more than 1000."
"He spent most of his retirement at Chartwell or at his London home in Hyde Park Gate, and became a habitué of high society at La Pausa on the French Riviera.In June 1962, when he was 87, Churchill had a fall in Monte Carlo and broke his hip."
"In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy, acting under authorisation granted by an Act of Congress, proclaimed him an honorary citizen of the United States, but he was unable to attend the White House ceremony."
"There has been speculation that he became very depressed in his final years but this has been emphatically denied by his personal secretary Anthony Montague Browne, who was with him for his last 10 years."
"Churchill suffered his final stroke on 12 January 1965 and died twelve days later on 24 January, the seventieth anniversary of his father's death."
His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days and the funeral ceremony was at St Paul's Cathedral on 30 January.
"Afterwards, the coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martin's Church, Bladon, near his birthplace at Blenheim Palace.Worldwide, numerous memorials have been dedicated to Churchill."
"Churchill College, Cambridge, was established as a national memorial to Churchill."
"Other memorials in North America include the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, where he made the 1946 ""Iron Curtain"" speech; Churchill Square in central Edmonton, Alberta; and the Winston Churchill Range, a mountain range northwest of Lake Louise, also in Alberta, which was renamed after Churchill in 1956.The Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College, Cambridge houses Churchill's personal papers and is open to the public."
"According to Colville, he had a brief affair in the 1930s with Doris Castlerosse, although this is discounted by Andrew Roberts.The Churchills' first child, Diana, was born in July 1909; the second, Randolph, in May 1911."
"On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child, Mary, was born."
"Later that month, the Churchills bought Chartwell, which would be their home until Winston's death in 1965."
"According to Jenkins, Churchill was an ""enthusiastic and loving father"" but one who expected too much of his children."

"Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings."
"There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate."
The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith.
"When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates."
"Paul Jobs was the son of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard."
"The couple moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana, where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman."
"Since Clara missed San Francisco, she convinced Paul to move back."
"In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple looked to adopt a child."
"Since they lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers, and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family, but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son's college tuition."
"In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church."
"When Steve was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she ""was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life ..."
"Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake."
"Many years later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that ""he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents""."
"Jobs would ""bristle"" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his ""adoptive parents"", and he regarded them as his parents ""1,000%""."
"Jobs referred to his biological parents as ""my sperm and egg bank."
"That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."""
"Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957, and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California."
"Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to ""pass along his love of mechanics""."
"Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship ""because he knew how to build anything."
"I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."""
"He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a ""loner""."
"His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son.Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene ""Teddy"" Hill, with turning him around: ""She taught an advanced fourth grade class, and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation."
I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school.
"They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language, but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."""
"Jobs was often ""bullied"" at Crittenden Middle, and in the middle of 7th grade, he gave his parents an ultimatum: either they would take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.The Jobs family was not affluent, and only by expending all their savings were they able to buy a new home in 1967, allowing Steve to change schools."
"The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, and was embedded in an environment even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area was."
"As of 2013, it was owned by Jobs's sister, Patty, and occupied by his stepmother, Marilyn.When he was 13, in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project."
Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class.
"Jobs later noted to his official biographer that ""I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology — Shakespeare, Plato."
"In a 1994 interview, he recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to design the blue boxes."
"He later recalled that on one occasion he consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale, and experienced ""the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point""."
"After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents."
Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents' money on an education that seemed meaningless to him.
"In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Jobs stated that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple."
"They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park."
"Fifty people, including Jobs's father, Paul, and his sister Mona, attended."
"The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa."
"The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike and Laurene's brothers' snowball fight."
"Jobs reportedly said to Mona: ""You see, Mona [...], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir"".Jobs's and Powell's first child, a son named Reed, was born in 1991."
"Jobs's father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993."
"Jobs's childhood home remains a tourist attraction and is currently owned by his stepmother (Paul's second wife), Marilyn Jobs.Jobs and Powell had two more children, daughters Erin (b."
"1998), who is a fashion model."
"The family lived in Palo Alto, California.Although a billionaire, Jobs made it known that, like Bill Gates, he had stipulated that most of his monetary fortune would not be left to his children."
"Both men had limited their children's access, age appropriate, to social media, computer games, and the Internet."
"Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs."
"Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however."
"He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson: ""I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out""."
"He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother."
"As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that ""his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble"".Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early 1986 and after he received permission from his father, Paul."
"Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need ""to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion."
Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers.
"Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother."
Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.
"Jobs later told his biographer that ""Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me ... As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family."
I can't imagine a better sister.
"My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."""
"Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona."
"They divorced in 1962 and he said then he lost contact with Mona for a time:

I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years."
"We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year."
"A few years later, Schieble married an ice-skating teacher, George Simpson."
"Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name, as Mona Simpson."
"In 1970, after divorcing her second husband, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her alone.When Simpson found that their father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was living in Sacramento, California, Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali didn't treat his children well and according to the San Francisco Chronicle, this was because of finding a Seattle Times article about Jandali's abandonment of his students on a trip to Egypt in 1974."
"Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali, who worked in a small restaurant."
"He said he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that ""we'll never see that baby again."
"At the request of Jobs, Simpson did not tell Jandali that she had met his son.After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that ""it was amazing ..."
"He then contacted Simpson and asked, ""what is this thing about Steve Jobs?""."
"Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, ""My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ..."
"Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did."
Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in her 1992 novel The Lost Father.
"Through his career, the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires."
"Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations.Mark Vermilion, former charitable leader for Joan Baez, Apple, and Jobs, attributed Jobs's lifelong minimization of direct charity to his perfectionism and limited time."
"In 1985, Jobs said, ""You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it’s humorous, all the attention to it, because it’s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me."
"In 2007, Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among ""America’s least philanthropic companies""."
"A few months after another unflattering news report, Apple started a program to match employees' charitable gifts."
"William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington as the only son of William H. Gates Sr. (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994)."
"His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America."
"Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president."
He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby.
"He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or ""Trey"" (i.e., three) because his father had the ""II"" suffix."
"The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.According to Gates, when he was young, his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law."
"During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination."
Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.
"One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money."
"Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language."
"Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life."
His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.

"Bill and Melinda have three children: Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe."
"Starting in 2000 with the foundation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and particularly after he stepped down as head of Microsoft, he turned his attention to philanthropy, spending more than $50 billion on causes like health, poverty, and education."
"His image morphed from ""tyrannical technocrat to saintly savior"" to a ""huggable billionaire techno-philanthropist"", celebrated on magazine covers and sought after for his opinions on major issues like global health and climate change."
"Criticisms included the interconnectivity of the non-profits with Gates, as well as his personal lack of formal credentials in medicine.Gates and the projects of his foundation have been the subject of many conspiracy theories that proliferate on Facebook and elsewhere."
"When asked about the theories, Gates has remarked that some people are tempted by the ""simple explanation"" that an evil person rather than biological factors are to blame, and that he does not know for what purpose anyone believes he would want to track them with microchips."
"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates said in regard to his faith: ""The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important."
"I mean, it's at least a moral belief."""
"In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed US$100 billion making him the first person ever to achieve the feat."
"In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person after  Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index."
"In October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world."
"On November 15, 2019, he once again became the richest person in the world after a 48% increase in Microsoft shares, surpassing Bezos."
"Gates told the BBC, ""I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so ..."
"Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest person from 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 2007, 2009, and held the spot until 2018 before being overtaken by Jeff Bezos."
"She was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi, to a teenaged mother, Vernita Lee, and father Vernon Winfrey."
Winfrey's parents never married.
"A genetic test in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the Kpelle ethnic group, in the area that today is Liberia."
"However, given the imprecision of genetic testing, the East Asian markers may actually be Native American.After Winfrey's birth, her mother traveled north, and Winfrey spent her first six years living in rural poverty with her maternal grandmother, Hattie Mae (Presley) Lee (April 15, 1900 – February 27, 1963)."
"Her grandmother was so poor that Winfrey often wore dresses made of potato sacks, for which other children made fun of her."
"Her grandmother taught her to read before the age of three and took her to the local church, where she was nicknamed ""The Preacher"" for her ability to recite Bible verses."
"When Winfrey was a child, her grandmother was reportedly abusive.At age six, Winfrey moved to an inner-city neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with her mother, who was less supportive and encouraging than her grandmother had been, largely as a result of the long hours she worked as a maid."
"Around this time, Lee had given birth to another daughter, Winfrey's younger half-sister, Patricia who died of causes related to cocaine addiction in February 2003 at age 43."
"By 1962, Lee was having difficulty raising both daughters, so Winfrey was temporarily sent to live with Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee."
"While Winfrey was in Nashville, Lee gave birth to a third daughter, who was put up for adoption in the hopes of easing the financial straits that had led to Lee's being on welfare, and was later also named Patricia."
Winfrey did not know that she had a second half-sister until 2010.
"By the time Winfrey moved back with her mother, Lee had also given birth to Winfrey's half-brother Jeffrey, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1989."
"At the age of eight, she was baptized in a Baptist church.Winfrey has stated she was molested by her cousin, uncle, and a family friend, starting when she was nine years old, something she first announced on a 1986 episode of her TV show regarding sexual abuse."
Winfrey once commented that she had chosen not to be a mother because she had not been mothered well.
"When she was 14, she became pregnant, but her son was born prematurely and died shortly after birth."
"Winfrey later stated she felt betrayed by the family member who had sold the story of her son to the National Enquirer in 1990.Winfrey attended Lincoln High School in Milwaukee, but after early success in the Upward Bound program, was transferred to the affluent suburban Nicolet High School."
She began to rebel and steal money from her mother in an effort to keep up with her free-spending peers.
"As a result, her mother once again sent her to live with Vernon in Nashville, although this time she did not take her back."
"In 1986, Winfrey said, ""'When my father took me, it changed the course of my life."
"However, she did not deliver her final paper and receive her degree until 1987, by which time she was a successful television personality.Winfrey's career in media would not have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey could talk, she was on stage."
"As a child, she played games interviewing her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property."
"Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and ""gave me a positive sense of myself""."

"In 2001, Oprah sold all five of her Fisher Island condos and purchased what would become her ""main home base"" she has also called ""The Promised Land"" (where she currently lives as of 2022), a (then) 42-acre (17-ha) estate with ocean and mountain views in Montecito, California."
"Similarly, in 2002, she purchased her father's home in Franklin, Tennessee and a lakefront condo in Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
"In 2006, Oprah purchased a co-op apartment along Lake Shore Drive in downtown Chicago, reportedly with plans to permanently move there from her prior adjoined-condo unit in Water Tower Place for the duration of her show but for reasons unknown, the property sat entirely unused until she sold it in 2012."

"Winfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and was a model student."
"She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year.In 1971, several months after breaking up with Otey, Winfrey met William ""Bubba"" Taylor at Tennessee State University."
"Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976."
He stuck with me through the whole demoralizing experience.
That man was the most fun romance I ever had.
"""According to Mair, when Kramer moved to NBC in New York, Winfrey had a love affair with a married man who had no intention of leaving his wife."
"The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him."
"""According to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: ""The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much."
"""Winfrey later confessed to smoking crack cocaine with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era."
Self-proclaimed former boyfriend Randolph Cook said they lived together for several months in 1985 and did drugs.
"In 1997, Cook tried to sue Winfrey for $20 million for allegedly blocking a tell-all book about their alleged relationship.In the mid-1980s, Winfrey briefly dated movie critic Roger Ebert, whom she credits with advising her to take her show into syndication.In 1985, before Winfrey's Chicago talk show had gone national, Haitian filmmaker Reginald Chevalier claims he appeared as a guest on a look-alike segment and began a relationship with Winfrey involving romantic evenings at home, candlelit baths, and dinners with Michael Jordan and Danny Glover."
"They were engaged to be married in November 1992, but the ceremony never took place."
"Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom Ellen in which Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay."
"""Winfrey has also had a long friendship with Maria Shriver, after they met in Baltimore."
"Winfrey considered Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, her mentor and close friend; she called Angelou her ""mother-sister-friend""."
"Born in rural poverty, and raised by a mother dependent on government welfare payments in a poor urban neighborhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at the age of 32 when her talk show received national syndication."

"In her early life, she would speak at local, mostly African American congregations of the Southern Baptist Convention that were often deeply religious and familiar with such themes as evangelical Protestantism, the Black church, and being born-again.She was quoted as saying: ""I have church with myself: I have church walking down the street."
"His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa."
"His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve."
"Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.Musk's family was wealthy during his youth."
His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.
"His maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane."
"After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father."
Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.
"He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.In a memorable incident, after having called a boy whose father had committed suicide ""stupid"", Musk was severely beaten and thrown down concrete steps."
His father derided Elon for his behavior and showed no sympathy for him despite his injuries.
"Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way."
"While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill."
Musk has 10 surviving children.
"He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000."
"In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks."
"In 2022, the eldest twin officially changed her name to reflect her gender identity as a trans woman and to use Wilson as her last name because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk."
"Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as ""the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists."
"Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017; he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they were dating."
Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.
"According to Musk and Grimes, his name was ""X Æ A-12"" (); however, the name would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet, and was then changed to ""X Æ A-Xii""."
"This drew more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English alphabet."
"The child was eventually named X AE A-XII Musk, with ""X"" as a first name, ""AE A-XII"" as a middle name, and ""Musk"" as surname."
"In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed ""Y""), born via surrogacy."
"Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again."
"In September 2023 it was revealed that the pair had a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus ""Tau"" Musk."
"On 29 October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son."
They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December.
"In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016."
"He accused the article from Business Insider of being a ""politically motivated hit piece""."
"After the release of the Business Insider article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%, decreasing Musk's net worth by $10 billion."
The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute.
"The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million."
"According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that ""Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public""."

"Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus."
"While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy."
"When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida so she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching."
"Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that ""he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls""."
"Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to ""go slowly"" and focus on school work."
"Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments."

"From age six to ten, he was registered in school as ""Barry"" and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother."
"As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child."
"During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him ""a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works"".In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham."
"Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii."
"Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work."
"His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."""
"Obama was also a member of the ""Choom Gang"" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana."
"After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship."
"In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks."
"After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985."
"Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side."
"Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir."
"Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living."
"Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency."
"In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War."
"He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s."
"He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down."
"The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended."
"In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed Sidley Austin."
"Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date."
"After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children."
"The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001."
The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools.
"When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School."
"In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket."
"He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president."
"He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed.In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.4 million in 2022) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago."
Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.
"He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ..."
"He described his father as a ""confirmed atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."""
"And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church."
"So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me."
"Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him ""of all the different people I've met along the way"", adding: ""I carry these around all the time."
"The items, ""a whole bowl full"", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa."
She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai.
The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours.
"She was given her first name Malala (meaning ""grief-stricken"") after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan."
"At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chickens.Fluent in Pashto, Urdu and English, Yousafzai was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, a poet, school owner, and an educational activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School."
"In an interview, she once said that she aspired to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead."
"Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.Inspired by the twice-elected, assassinated Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to Peshawar to speak at the local press club."
They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there.
"Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala."
"At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but her parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals."
My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school.
They had already blown up more than 100 girls' schools.
"Following the edict, the Pakistani Taliban destroyed several more local schools."
"On 7 February, Yousafzai and her brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an ""eerie silence""."
"She wrote in her blog: ""We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late."
"Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended out of the 700 who were enrolled.On 15 February, gunshots were heard in Mingora's streets, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying, ""Don't be scared—this is firing for peace."""
Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day.
"Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: ""People are again scared that the peace may not last for long."
"After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by New York Times reporter Adam B. Ellick about filming a documentary."
"In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat (also known as Operation Rah-e-Rast)."
"Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives."
"""I'm really bored because I have no books to read,"" she is filmed saying in the documentary.That month, after criticising militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Pakistani Taliban commander."
Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father.
"From 2009 to 2010 she was the chair of the District Child Assembly of the Khpal Kor Foundation.In 2011, Yousafzai trained with local girls' empowerment organisation, Aware Girls, run by Gulalai Ismail, whose training included advice on women's rights and empowerment to peacefully oppose radicalisation through education.In October 2011, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a South African activist, nominated Yousafzai for the International Children's Peace Prize of the Dutch international children's advocacy group, KidsRights Foundation."
The award was won by Michaela Mycroft of South Africa.Yousafzai's public profile rose even further when she was awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December.
"At the ceremony, she stated she was not a member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education."
"In a television interview the same year, she named Barack Obama, Benazir Bhutto and Abdul Ghaffar Khan (Bacha Khan), a Pashtun leader known for his nonviolent Khudai Khidmatgar resistance movement against the British Raj, as inspirations for her activism."
"Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother."
"Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her."
"Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies."
"Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran."
Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent.
"In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c. 1898–1951), Adriana (c. 1902–1968), and Cristina (c. 1908–1964)."
"She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent.Kahlo later described the atmosphere in her childhood home as often ""very, very sad""."
"Both parents were often sick, and their marriage was devoid of love."
"Her relationship with her mother, Matilde, was extremely tense."
"Kahlo described her mother as ""kind, active and intelligent, but also calculating, cruel and fanatically religious""."
"Her father Guillermo's photography business suffered greatly during the Mexican Revolution, as the overthrown government had commissioned works from him, and the long civil war limited the number of private clients.When Kahlo was six years old, she contracted polio, which eventually made her right leg grow shorter and thinner than the left."
"The illness forced her to be isolated from her peers for months, and she was bullied."
"While the experience made her reclusive, it made her Guillermo's favorite due to their shared experience of living with disability."
"Kahlo credited him for making her childhood ""marvelous ... he was an immense example to me of tenderness, of work (photographer and also painter), and above all in understanding for all my problems."""
"He taught her about literature, nature, and philosophy, and encouraged her to play sports to regain her strength, despite the fact that most physical exercise was seen as unsuitable for girls."
"Along with her younger sister Cristina, she attended the local kindergarten and primary school in Coyoacán and was homeschooled for the fifth and sixth grades."
"While Cristina followed their sisters into a convent school, Kahlo was enrolled in a German school due to their father's wishes."
"The school promoted indigenismo, a new sense of Mexican identity that took pride in the country's indigenous heritage and sought to rid itself of the colonial mindset of Europe as superior to Mexico."
"To mask the fact that she was older and to declare herself a ""daughter of the revolution"", she began saying that she had been born on 7 July 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution began, which she continued throughout her life."
Her parents did not approve of the relationship.
"The handrail was removed by Arias and others, which was incredibly painful for Kahlo.Kahlo suffered many injuries: her pelvic bone had been fractured, her abdomen and uterus had been punctured by the rail, her spine was broken in three places, her right leg was broken in eleven places, her right foot was crushed and dislocated, her collarbone was broken, and her shoulder was dislocated."
She spent a month in hospital and two months recovering at home before being able to return to work.
"As treatment she had to wear a plaster corset which confined her to bed rest for the better part of three months.The accident ended Kahlo's dreams of becoming a physician and caused her pain and illness for the rest of her life; her friend Andrés Henestrosa stated that Kahlo ""lived dying""."
"They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ..."
"Kahlo soon began a relationship with Rivera, who was 21 years her senior and had two common-law wives."
Kahlo and Rivera were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall of Coyoacán on 21 August 1929.
"Her mother opposed the marriage, and both parents referred to it as a ""marriage between an elephant and a dove"", referring to the couple's differences in size; Rivera was tall and overweight while Kahlo was petite and fragile."
"Regardless, her father approved of Rivera, who was wealthy and therefore able to support Kahlo, who could not work and had to receive expensive medical treatment."
"The wedding was reported by the Mexican and international press, and the marriage was subject to constant media attention in Mexico in the following years, with articles referring to the couple as simply ""Diego and Frida"".Soon after the marriage, in late 1929, Kahlo and Rivera moved to Cuernavaca in the rural state of Morelos, where he had been commissioned to paint murals for the Palace of Cortés."
"Around the same time, she resigned her membership of the PCM in support of Rivera, who had been expelled shortly before the marriage for his support of the leftist opposition movement within the Third International.During the civil war Morelos had seen some of the heaviest fighting, and life in the Spanish-style city of Cuernavaca sharpened Kahlo's sense of a Mexican identity and history."
"After Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to San Francisco, where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the California School of Fine Arts."
"Her long love affair with Hungarian-American photographer Nickolas Muray most likely began around this time.Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico for the summer of 1931, and in the fall traveled to New York City for the opening of Rivera's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)."
"Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, as well as most Americans, whom she found ""boring""."
"In a letter to a friend, she wrote that ""although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States"", she felt ""a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night while thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger."""
Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in her marriage to Rivera.
"Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks."
"Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico."
"Back in Mexico City, Kahlo and Rivera moved into a new house in the wealthy neighborhood of San Ángel."
"While he had been unfaithful to her before, he now embarked on an affair with her younger sister Cristina, which deeply hurt Kahlo's feelings."
"After discovering the affair in early 1935, she moved to an apartment in central Mexico City and considered divorcing him."
She also had an affair of her own with American artist Isamu Noguchi.Kahlo was reconciled with Rivera and Cristina later in 1935 and moved back to San Ángel.
"She became a loving aunt to Cristina's children, Isolda and Antonio."
"The exact reasons for his decision are unknown, but he stated publicly that it was merely a ""matter of legal convenience in the style of modern times ... there are no sentimental, artistic, or economic reasons""."
"Following her separation from Rivera, Kahlo moved back to La Casa Azul and, determined to earn her own living, began another productive period as an artist, inspired by her experiences abroad."
"Encouraged by the recognition she was gaining, she moved from using the small and more intimate tin sheets she had used since 1932 to large canvases, as they were easier to exhibit."
"She also adopted a more sophisticated technique, limited the graphic details, and began to produce more quarter-length portraits, which were easier to sell."
"She painted several of her most famous pieces during this period, such as The Two Fridas (1939), Self-portrait with Cropped Hair (1940), The Wounded Table (1940), and Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940)."
"Kahlo was briefly suspected of being involved, as she knew the murderer, and was arrested and held for two days with her sister Cristina."
"The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection on her hand."
They remarried in a simple civil ceremony on 8 December 1940.
"Both were more independent, and while La Casa Azul was their primary residence, Rivera retained the San Ángel house for use as his studio and second apartment."
"Both continued having extramarital affairs; Kahlo, being bisexual, had affairs with both men and women, with evidence suggesting her male lovers were more important to Kahlo than her female lovers."
The death of her father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression.
"She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.While Kahlo was gaining recognition in her home country, her health continued to decline."
"In 1950, Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City, where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine."
"After being discharged, she was mostly confined to La Casa Azul, using a wheelchair and crutches to be ambulatory."
"She wrote in her diary in February 1954, ""They amputated my leg six months ago, they have given me centuries of torture and at moments I almost lost my reason."
But never in my life have I suffered more.
"I will wait a while..."" In her last days, Kahlo was mostly bedridden with bronchopneumonia, though she made a public appearance on 2 July 1954, participating with Rivera in a demonstration against the CIA invasion of Guatemala."
"It was accompanied by the last words she wrote, ""I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return – Frida"" (""Espero Alegre la Salida – y Espero no Volver jamás"").The demonstration worsened her illness, and on the night of 12 July 1954, Kahlo had a high fever and was in extreme pain."
"The official cause of death was pulmonary embolism, although no autopsy was performed."
"The nurse, who counted Kahlo's painkillers to monitor her drug use, stated that Kahlo had taken an overdose the night she died."
"She had also given Rivera a wedding anniversary present that evening, over a month in advance.On the evening of 13 July, Kahlo's body was taken to the Palacio de Bellas Artes, where it lay in state under a Communist flag."
"The following day, it was carried to the Panteón Civil de Dolores, where friends and family attended an informal funeral ceremony."
"Rivera, who stated that her death was ""the most tragic day of my life"", died three years later, in 1957."
"King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams)."
"King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel ""A. D."" King."
"Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams, was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893, and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year."
"In his adolescent years, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta where he attained a high school education, and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry."
"Until Jennie's death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' two-story Victorian house, where King was born.Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church."
"In reaction, the BWA issued a resolution stating, ""This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world."""
"On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr."
"At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father."
"After dinners there, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as ""Mama"", would tell lively stories from the Bible to her grandchildren."
King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children.
"At times, King Sr. would also have his children whip each other."
"King's father later remarked, ""[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him."
"Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it."
"When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit into their grandmother, Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive."
"Upon hearing that his grandmother was alive, King rose and left the ground where he had fallen.King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his family's home."
"King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School, while his close playmate went to a separate school for white children only."
"Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, ""we are white, and you are colored""."
"When King relayed the happenings to his parents, they had a long discussion with him about the history of slavery and racism in America."
"Upon learning of the hatred, violence and oppression that black people had faced in the U.S., King would later state that he was ""determined to hate every white person""."
His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and various forms of discrimination.
"Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as ""boy"", King's father responded sharply that King was a boy but he was a man."
"When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back."
"King's father refused, stating ""we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all"", before taking King and leaving the store."
"In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination."
"King later remarked that King Sr. was ""a real father"" to him.King memorized and sang hymns, and stated verses from the Bible, by the time he was five years old."
"Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano."
"His favorite hymn to sing was ""I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus""; he moved attendees with his singing."
"While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in his history and English classes.On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother."
"His father instructed him in his bedroom that King should not blame himself for her death, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan that could not be changed."
"King struggled with this, and could not fully believe that his parents knew where his grandmother had gone."
"Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill that overlooked downtown Atlanta."
"It had been formed after local black leaders, including King's grandfather (Williams), urged the city government of Atlanta to create it.While King was brought up in a Baptist home, King grew skeptical of some of Christianity's claims as he entered adolescence."
He began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father's church.
"King said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays and gestures from congregants frequent at his church, and doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion."
"King continued to be most drawn to history and English, and chose English and sociology to be his main subjects while at the school."
"However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with his spelling, while King assisted her with math."
"King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly adorning himself in well polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname ""Tweed"" or ""Tweedie"" among his friends."
"His brother A. D. later remarked, ""He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn't keep up with him."
"The driver of the bus called King a ""black son-of-a-bitch""."
"Later King wrote of the incident, saying ""That night will never leave my memory."
"During King's junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King's father and maternal grandfather had attended—began accepting high school juniors who passed the school's entrance examination."
"In 1944, at the age of 15, King passed the entrance examination and was enrolled at the university for the school season that autumn.In the summer before King started his freshman year at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett ""Weasel"" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco (a cigar business)."
"In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him between the two parts of the country, ""On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see."
"On Friday evenings, King and the other students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants."
"King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation in Connecticut, relaying how he was amazed they could go to ""one of the finest restaurants in Hartford"" and that ""Negroes and whites go to the same church"".He played freshman football there."
"King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer ""an inner urge to serve humanity""."
"His ""inner urge"" had begun developing, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a ""rational"" minister with sermons that were ""a respectful force for ideas, even social protest."""
"King's father fully supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with prominent Crozer alum, J. Pius Barbour, a family friend who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania."
The African-American students of Crozer for the most part conducted their social activity on Edwards Street.
"In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked as a dietitian in the cafeteria."
"King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King's father, advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South."
King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later.
Hester was an old friend of King's father and was an important influence on King.
"In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury (and younger brother of jazz drummer Roy Haynes)."
"The young men often held bull sessions in their various apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues."
"King received his PhD degree on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter's death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.An academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly."
"King married Coretta Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of Heiberger, Alabama."
"They became the parents of four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b."
"During their marriage, King limited Coretta's role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.In December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC."
"In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, and helped expand the Civil Rights Movement across the South."
"Earhart was born on July 24, 1897, in Atchison, Kansas, the daughter of Samuel ""Edwin"" Stanton Earhart (1867–1930) and Amelia ""Amy"" (née Otis; 1869–1962)."
"She was born in the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Gideon Otis (1827–1912), who was a former federal judge, the president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in the town."
Earhart was the second child of the marriage after an infant was stillborn in August 1896.
"Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's progress as a lawyer.According to family custom, Earhart was named after her two grandmothers, Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton."
"From an early age, Earhart was the ringleader while her sister Grace Muriel Earhart (1899–1998), two years her junior, acted as the dutiful follower."
"Amelia was nicknamed ""Meeley"" (sometimes ""Millie"") and Grace was nicknamed ""Pidge""; both girls continued to answer to their childhood nicknames well into adulthood."
"Their upbringing was unconventional, as Amy Earhart did not believe in raising her children to be ""nice little girls""."
"But their maternal grandmother disapproved of the ""bloomers"" they wore, and although Earhart liked the freedom of movement they provided, she was sensitive to the fact that the neighborhood's girls wore dresses."
"A spirit of adventure seemed to abide in the Earhart children, with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood."
"As a child, Earhart spent long hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle, and ""belly-slamming"" her sled downhill."
"Although the love of the outdoors and ""rough-and-tumble"" play was common to many youngsters, some biographers have characterized the young Earhart as a tomboy."
"The girls kept ""worms, moths, katydids and a tree toad"" in a growing collection gathered in their outings."
Her father tried to interest his daughters in taking a flight.
"Sisters Amelia and Muriel (who went by her middle name from her teens on) remained with their grandparents in Atchison while their parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines."
"During this period, the Earhart girls received home-schooling from their mother and governess."
"In 1909, when the family was finally reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time and Amelia, 12, entered seventh grade."
"While the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent that Edwin was an alcoholic."
"At about this time, Earhart's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in a trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds."
"The Otis house was auctioned along with all of its contents; Earhart was heartbroken and later described it as the end of her childhood.In 1915, after a long search, Earhart's father found work as a clerk at the Great Northern Railway in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Earhart entered Central High School as a junior."
"Facing another calamitous move, Amy Earhart took her children to Chicago, where they lived with friends."
"Throughout her troubled childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management, and mechanical engineering."
"She began junior college at Ogontz School in Rydal, Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.During Christmas vacation in 1917, Earhart visited her sister in Toronto."
"She became a patient herself, experiencing pneumonia and maxillary sinusitis."
"She was hospitalized for pneumonia in early November 1918 and discharged in December 1918, about two months after the illness had started."
"Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in Northampton, Massachusetts."
"""By 1919, Earhart prepared to enter Smith College, where her sister was a student."
"Earhart quit a year later to be with her parents, who had reunited in California."
"On December 28, 1920, Earhart and her father attended an ""aerial meet"" at Daugherty Field in Long Beach, California."
"She asked her father, Edwin, to ask about passenger flights and flying lessons."
"She was booked for a passenger flight the following day at Emory Roger's Field, at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue."
The next month Earhart recruited Neta Snook to be her flying instructor.
"Working at a variety of jobs including photographer, truck driver, and stenographer at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons."
"Earhart had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field on the west side of Long Beach Boulevard and Tweedy Road, now in the city of South Gate."
"Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 ""stake"" against her ""better judgement"".Earhart's commitment to flying required her to accept the frequent hard work and rudimentary conditions that accompanied early aviation training."
"Six months later in the summer of 1921, Earhart purchased a secondhand bright chromium yellow Kinner Airster biplane, against Snook's advice, which she nicknamed ""The Canary""."
He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.
His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game.
"For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum."
"Pablo's maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age."
"According to his mother, his first words were ""piz, piz"", a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for ""pencil""."
"From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting."
"Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models."
"His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.The family moved to A Coruña in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts."
They stayed almost four years.
"On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon."
"Observing the precision of his son's technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.In 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria."
"After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts."
Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class.
"This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13."
"His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings."
"The two argued frequently.Picasso's father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, the country's foremost art school."

"Biographer John Richardson stated that 'work, sex and tobacco' were his addictions."
"Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:

Paulo (4 February 1921 – 5 June 1975, Paul Joseph Picasso) – with Olga Khokhlova
Maya (5 September 1935 – 20 December 2022, Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) – with Marie-Thérèse Walter
Claude (15 May 1947 – 24 August 2023, Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) – with Françoise Gilot
Paloma (born 19 April 1949, Anne Paloma Picasso) – with Françoise GilotPhotographer and painter Dora Maar was a constant companion and lover of Picasso."
"The two were closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of Guernica.The women in Picasso's life played an important role in the emotional and erotic aspects of his creative expression, and the tumultuous nature of these relationships has been considered vital to his artistic process."
A largely recurring motif in his body of work is the female form.
"In her memoir, Picasso, My Grandfather, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, ""He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas."
"His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression."
"His grandson, Pablito, also died by suicide that same year by ingesting bleach when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artist's funeral."

"However, five weeks later her spiritual dryness returned.Mother Teresa wrote many letters to her confessors and superiors over a 66-year period, most notably to Calcutta Archbishop Ferdinand Perier and Jesuit priest Celeste van Exem (her spiritual advisor since the formation of the Missionaries of Charity)."
"She requested that her letters be destroyed, concerned that ""people will think more of me – less of Jesus."""
"[But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see – listen and do not hear – the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak."
"The Sisters of Charity recite the prayer of Saint Francis every morning at Mass during the thanksgiving after Communion, and their emphasis on ministry and many of their vows are similar."

"Bezos was born ""Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen"" on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen."
"At the time of Jeff's birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high-school student and his father was 19-years-old."
"Jacklyn left her husband to live with her parents, filing for divorce in June 1965 when Jeff was 17-months-old."
"After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel ""Mike"" Bezos in April 1968."
"Gise, her husband and her son left the area and asked Jorgensen to discontinue contact, to which he agreed.After Mike had received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon."
"Jeff's maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque."
Jeff displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room.
"The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Jeff attended Miami Palmetto High School."

"In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon."
"Bezos and his now ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons and a daughter adopted from China.In March 2003, Bezos was a passenger in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas while surveying land to buy for Blue Origin; the other 3 occupants in the helicopter were pilot Charles ""Cheater"" Bella, Amazon lawyer Elizabeth Korrell, and local rancher Ty Holland."
"All survived; Bezos sustained only minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.Bezos portrayed a Starfleet official in the 2016 movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening."
He had lobbied Paramount for the role apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition.
"Subsequently, National Enquirer revealed that Bezos had an affair with media personality Lauren Sánchez; the affair with Sánchez had lasted for months."
"Media reports have accused Sánchez's brother Michael of being the source for the photos obtained by National Enquirer; however, Bezos has speculated that it may have been the Saudi Arabian government.On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple's Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6 billion) in Amazon stock."

"The following year, she married Derek Bryceson, a member of Tanzania's parliament and the director of that country's national parks."
Bryceson died of cancer in October 1980.
"Owing to his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson could protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe.Goodall has stated that dogs are her favourite animal.Goodall has prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize familiar faces."

"Her family were occasional churchgoers, but Goodall began attending more regularly as a teenager when the church appointed a new minister, Trevor Davies."
"""He was highly intelligent and his sermons were powerful and thought-provoking..."
"Of her later discovery of the atheism and agnosticism of many of her scientific colleagues, Goodall wrote that ""[f]ortunately, by the time I got to Cambridge I was twenty-seven years old and my beliefs had already moulded so that I was not influenced by these opinions."
"""In her 1999 book Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey, Goodall describes the implications of a mystical experience she had at Notre Dame Cathedral in 1977: ""Since I cannot believe that this was the result of chance, I have to admit anti-chance."
"and stated that she saw no contradiction between evolution and belief in God.In her foreword to the 2017 book The Intelligence of the Cosmos by Ervin Laszlo, a philosopher of science who advocates quantum consciousness theory, Goodall wrote: ""we must accept that there is an Intelligence driving the process [of evolution], that the Universe and life on Earth are inspired and in-formed by an unknown and unknowable Creator, a Supreme Being, a Great Spiritual Power."""
"Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland."
"His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century."
His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.
"Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics."
"Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire."
"In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book."
"During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa, the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves."
"In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months."
"Hawking's father wanted his son to attend Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination."
"A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception."
"Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates."
"He also wanted his son to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater."
"For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely – he found the academic work ""ridiculously easy""."
"A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort ""to be one of the boys""."
A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.
"He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners ""were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves""."
"He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology."
"After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression – though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point."
His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted.
"Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded."
"There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge; he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966; and his essay ""Singularities and the Geometry of Space–Time"" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize."
"The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease."
"The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967, Lucy, born November 1970, and Timothy, born April 1979.Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges—even, in a precedent set during their courtship, with Jane."
"His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics."
"In the late 1980s, Hawking grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness."
"In February 1990, Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason, and departed the family home."
"After his divorce from Jane in 1995, Hawking married Mason in September, declaring, ""It's wonderful – I have married the woman I love."
"""In 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown."
"Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself."
"Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.In 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced, and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren."
"Hawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades.Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing."
"He preferred to be regarded as ""a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."""
"Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.When Hawking first began using a wheelchair he was using standard motorised models."
"Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking attending NASA's 50th anniversary; a Permobil C350 from 2014; and then a Permobil F3 from 2016.Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends."
"His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated."
"One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card, but in 1986 he received a computer program called the ""Equalizer"" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write."
"Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that ""I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."""
"Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered.Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles, with a rate of about one word per minute."
"Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin."
"This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy."
"Starting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities."
"In 1999, Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society.In August 2012, Hawking narrated the ""Enlightenment"" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London."
"In August 2014, Hawking accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research."
"As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf."
"In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space; on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted."
"Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities."
"On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727–200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness."
"He and his three sisters (Arielle,  Randi, and  Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household in Dobbs Ferry, New York."
"His great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland."
"He and his three sisters (Arielle,  Randi, and  Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household in Dobbs Ferry, New York."
"His great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland."
"In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other."
"In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups."
"Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos."
"The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet."
"Zuckerberg met his future wife, fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan, at a frat party during his sophomore year there."
"In September 2010, Chan, who was by then a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco, moved into Zuckerberg's rented house in Palo Alto, California."
"Their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg, was born on December 1, 2015."
They announced in a Chinese New Year video that their daughter's Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: 陈明宇).
"Their second daughter, August, was born in August 2017."
"Zuckerberg and his wife welcomed their third daughter Aurelia on March 24, 2023, and announced the news across his social media pages."
"In 2017, Zuckerberg and his wife began a nationwide tour ""to visit every state in the union and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social network""."
"Motherboard implicitly criticized this by comparing it to another potential regret: Facebook's ""enabling genocide in Myanmar because it did not bother to hire moderators who speak Burmese"", an incident for which Zuckerberg apologized at the time."
"On July 22, 2023, Zuckerberg was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Dave Camarillo."
"Four months later, Zuckerberg announced that he was preparing to make his MMA debut but had suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training that required surgery and had delayed this."
"He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn."
"In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina."
"He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level."
"His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games."
"Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play."
"As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 ppg, 12 rebounds (rpg), and six assists per game (apg) for the season."

"They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine."
"Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.Jordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church."
"It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together."

"Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family."
"He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home."
"The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583."
"Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585."
"Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area."
"Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called ""University Wits"")."
"As used here, Johannes Factotum (""Jack of all trades"") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common ""universal genius"".Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre."
The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).
The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.
"In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father."
"He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there."
"By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses."
"Nicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford ""some years before his death""."
"The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work."
Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.
"In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary."
"In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall."
"He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in ""perfect health""."
"Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: ""Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted"", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton."
He was survived by his wife and two daughters.
"Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death."
"Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, Thomas Quiney, his new son-in-law, was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, both of whom had died during childbirth."
"Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to ""the first son of her body""."
"The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying."
"The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line."
"Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance."
"The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:
Some time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing."
"Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey."
"Marilyn Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926, at the Los Angeles General Hospital in Los Angeles, California."
"Her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe; 1902–1984), was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico to a poor Midwestern family who migrated to California at the turn of the century."
"They had two children together, Robert (1918–1933) and Berniece (1919–2014)."
"She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody of her two oldest in 1923, but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native Kentucky.Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and they met for the first time in 1944 when Monroe was 17 or 18."
"Her second marriage occurred in 1924 when she married Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated just months later and divorced in 1928."
"In 2022, DNA testing indicated that Monroe's father was Charles Stanley Gifford (1898–1965),
a co-worker of Gladys, with whom she had an affair in 1925."
"Monroe also had two other half-siblings from Gifford's marriage with his first wife, a sister, Doris Elizabeth (1920–1933), and a brother, Charles Stanley Jr. (1922–2015).Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy."
Gladys placed her daughter with evangelical Christian foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne.
"She also lived there for six months, until she was forced to move back to the city for employment."
She then began visiting her daughter on weekends.
"In the summer of 1933, Gladys bought a small house in Hollywood with a loan from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and moved seven-year-old Monroe in with her."
"They shared the house with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie."
"After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital."
"Monroe became a ward of the state, and her mother's friend Grace Goddard took responsibility over her and her mother's affairs."
"For the first 16 months, she continued living with the Atkinsons, and may have been sexually abused during this time."
"The orphanage was ""a model institution"" and was described in positive terms by her peers, but Monroe felt abandoned."
Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc molested her.
"She then lived for brief periods with her relatives and Grace's friends and relatives in Los Angeles and Compton.Monroe's childhood experiences first made her want to become an actress: ""I didn't like the world around me because it was kind of grim ..."
Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night.
"""Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt Ana Lower in the west-side district of Sawtelle."
She was enrolled at Emerson Junior High School and went to weekly Christian Science services with Lower.
"California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced having to return to the orphanage."
"As a solution, she married their neighbors' 21-year-old son, factory worker James Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday."
"In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine and was stationed on Santa Catalina Island, where Monroe moved with him."
"In April 1944, Dougherty was shipped out to the Pacific, where he remained for most of the next two years."
"Monroe moved in with her in-laws and began a job at the Radioplane Company, a munitions factory in Van Nuys."
"In late 1944, she met photographer David Conover, who had been sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers."
"Although none of her pictures were used, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends."
"Defying her deployed husband, she moved on her own and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.The agency deemed Monroe's figure more suitable for pin-up than high fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines."
"To make herself more employable, she straightened her hair and dyed it blonde."
"According to Emmeline Snively, the agency's owner, Monroe quickly became one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S."
"As a model, Monroe occasionally used the pseudonym Jean Norman."
"After an unsuccessful interview at Paramount Pictures, she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon, a 20th Century-Fox executive."
"Head executive Darryl F. Zanuck was unenthusiastic about it, but he gave her a standard six-month contract to avoid her being signed by rival studio RKO Pictures."
"The first name was picked by Lyon, who was reminded of Broadway star Marilyn Miller; the surname was Monroe's mother's maiden name."
"In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who opposed her career.Monroe spent her first six months at Fox learning acting, singing, and dancing, and observing the film-making process."
"She returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at film studios, such as working as a dancing ""pacer"" behind the scenes to keep the leads on point at musical sets."
"She had a small role in the play Glamour Preferred at the Bliss-Hayden Theater, but it ended after a couple of performances."
"She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive Joseph M. Schenck, who persuaded his friend Harry Cohn, the head executive of Columbia Pictures, to sign her in March 1948.At Columbia, Monroe's look was modeled after Rita Hayworth and her hair was bleached platinum blonde."
Ladies of the Chorus was released the following month and was not a success.
"When her contract at Columbia ended, Monroe returned again to modeling."
"Despite her screen time being only a few minutes in the latter, she gained a mention in Photoplay and according to biographer Donald Spoto ""moved effectively from movie model to serious actress""."
"In 1951, Monroe had supporting roles in three moderately successful Fox comedies: As Young as You Feel, Love Nest, and Let's Make It Legal."
"In February 1952, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Monroe the ""best young box office personality""."
"In early 1952, she began a highly publicized romance with retired New York Yankees baseball star Joe DiMaggio, one of the most famous sports personalities of the era."
"The studio had learned about the photos and that she was publicly rumored to be the model some weeks prior, and together with Monroe decided that to prevent damaging her career it was best to admit to them while stressing that she had been broke at the time."
"Three of Monroe's films—Clash by Night, Don't Bother to Knock and We're Not Married!—were released soon after to capitalize on the public interest.Despite her newfound popularity as a sex symbol, Monroe also wished to showcase more of her acting range."
"In We're Not Married!, her role as a beauty pageant contestant was created solely to ""present Marilyn in two bathing suits"", according to its writer Nunnally Johnson."
"In Howard Hawks's Monkey Business, in which she acted opposite Cary Grant, she played a secretary who is a ""dumb, childish blonde, innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness causes around her""."
"Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with publicity stunts that year: she wore a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the Miss America Pageant parade, and told gossip columnist Earl Wilson that she usually wore no underwear."
"She disliked her lack of control on film sets and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script."
Monroe starred in three movies that were released in 1953 and emerged as a major sex symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers.
"According to Sarah Churchwell, Niagara was one of the most overtly sexual films of Monroe's career."
"Niagara's most famous scene is a 30-second long shot behind Monroe where she is seen walking with her hips swaying, which was used heavily in the film's marketing.When Niagara was released in January 1953, women's clubs protested it as immoral, but it proved popular with audiences."
"While Variety deemed it ""clichéd"" and ""morbid"", The New York Times commented that ""the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see"", as although Monroe may not be ""the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive—even when she walks""."
"Monroe continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits, most famously at the Photoplay Awards in January 1953, where she won the ""Fastest Rising Star"" award."
"Prompted by such imagery, veteran star Joan Crawford publicly called the behavior ""unbecoming an actress and a lady"".While Niagara made Monroe a sex symbol and established her ""look"", her second film of 1953, the satirical musical comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, cemented her screen persona as a ""dumb blonde""."
"Monroe's role was originally intended for Betty Grable, who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular ""blonde bombshell"" in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to both male and female audiences."
"Crowther of The New York Times and William Brogdon of Variety both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend""; according to the latter, she demonstrated the ""ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence"".In September, Monroe made her television debut in the Jack Benny Show, playing Jack's fantasy woman in the episode ""Honolulu Trip""."
"She co-starred with Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall in her third movie of the year, How to Marry a Millionaire, released in November."
"It featured Monroe as a naïve model who teams up with her friends to find rich husbands, repeating the successful formula of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."
"Despite mixed reviews, the film was Monroe's biggest box office success at that point in her career.Monroe was listed in the annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in both 1953 and 1954, and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studio's ""greatest asset"" alongside CinemaScope."
"Her attempts to appear in films that would not focus on her as a pin-up had been thwarted by the studio head executive, Darryl F. Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in other types of roles."
"They then traveled by car first to Paso Robles, then south to nearby San Luis Obispo the day after, before spending their honeymoon outside Idyllwild, California, in the mountain lodge of Monroe's lawyer Lloyd Wright."
"On January 29, 1954, fifteen days later, they flew to Japan, combining a ""honeymoon"" with his commitment to his former San Francisco Seals coach Lefty O'Doul, to help train Japanese baseball teams."
"From Tokyo, she traveled with Jean O'Doul, Lefty's wife, to Korea, where she participated in a USO show, singing songs from her films for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period."
"She called it a ""Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process"", but it was popular with audiences."
"The ""subway grate scene"" became one of Monroe's most famous, and The Seven Year Itch became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year after its release in June 1955.The publicity stunt placed Monroe on international front pages, and it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it."
"After returning from NYC to Hollywood in October 1954, Monroe filed for divorce, after only nine months of marriage.After filming for The Seven Year Itch wrapped up in November 1954, Monroe left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she and photographer Milton Greene founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)—an action that has later been called ""instrumental"" in the collapse of the studio system."
"After founding MMP, Monroe moved to Manhattan and spent 1955 studying acting."
"She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became a family member."
"Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis, as Strasberg believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce process; she also dated actor Marlon Brando and playwright Arthur Miller."
"In contrast, Monroe's relationship with Miller prompted some negative comments, such as Walter Winchell's statement that ""America's best-known blonde moving picture star is now the darling of the left-wing intelligentsia."
"For the role, she learned an Ozark accent, chose costumes and makeup that lacked the glamor of her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing."
"On June 29, 1956, Monroe and Miller were married at the Westchester County Court in White Plains, New York; two days later they had a Jewish ceremony at the home of Kay Brown, Miller's literary agent, in Waccabuc, New York."
"The Saturday Review of Literature wrote that Monroe's performance ""effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour personality"" and Crowther proclaimed: ""Hold on to your chairs, everybody, and get set for a rattling surprise."
"It was better received in Europe, where she was awarded the Italian David di Donatello and the French Crystal Star awards and nominated for a BAFTA.After returning from England, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus to concentrate on family life."
"She had an ectopic pregnancy in mid-1957, and a miscarriage a year later; these problems were most likely linked to her endometriosis."
"Monroe returned to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot."
"Monroe demanded dozens of retakes, and did not remember her lines or act as directed—Curtis famously said that kissing her was ""like kissing Hitler"" due to the number of retakes."
"Crowther described Monroe as appearing ""rather untidy"" and ""lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism"", and Hedda Hopper called the film ""the most vulgar picture she's ever done""."
"The filming in Reno, and in the Nevada desert east of Carson City between July and November 1960 was again difficult."
"Monroe's and Miller's marriage was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with Magnum movie photographer Inge Morath."
"Despite her problems, Huston said that when Monroe was acting, she ""was not pretending to an emotion."
"The Misfits was released the following month, failing at the box office."
It has received more favorable reviews in the 21st century.
"Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called it a classic, Huston scholar Tony Tracy called Monroe's performance the ""most mature interpretation of her career"", and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent praised her ""extraordinary"" portrayal of the character's ""power of empathy"".Monroe was next to star in a television adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's ""Rain"" for NBC, but the project fell through as the network did not want to hire her choice of director, Lee Strasberg."
"Instead of working, she spent the first six months of 1961 preoccupied by health problems."
"She was helped by DiMaggio, with whom she rekindled a friendship, and dated his friend Frank Sinatra for several months."
"Monroe also moved permanently back to California in 1961, purchasing a house at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in Brentwood, Los Angeles, in early 1962."
"Despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April.Monroe was too sick to work for most of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio pressured her by alleging publicly that she was faking it."
"On May 19, she took a break to sing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" on stage at President John F. Kennedy's early birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York."
"Monroe's trip to New York caused even more irritation for Fox executives, who had wanted her to cancel it.Monroe next filmed a scene for Something's Got to Give in which she swam naked in a swimming pool."
"To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue."
"For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs over three days, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting."

## Geneology Extractor
We thought that this project sounded like fun.
At the beginning we felt like it was going to be easy, but we gave it some thought and found the various complexities we could face in the project.
One major component we would like to purpose is tagging the speaker for sentences like "He is my brother" or general context queues.
In and of itself this will be a side project we need to pursue in order to find a lot of the relations.
Most texts are not like genesis 5 in the old testement so we will need to use this speaker tagging.
As a first goal we would aim to extract the easy stuff though, like in genesis 5.
We all felt that this project would engage us and would be a great problem to solve so we would really enjoy having this for our project.

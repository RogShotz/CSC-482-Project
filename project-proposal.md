## Geneology Extractor
We thought that this project sounded interesting.
Some of the challenges that could we think could come about from this project are detection of the speaker, whether they are a character or simply a third person, and detection of the relationships when speaking as a third or first person.
One major component we would like to propose is tagging the speaker for sentences like "He is my brother" or general context queues.
In and of itself, this will be a sub-problem of the project we need to pursue in order to find a lot of the relations.
Most texts are not like genesis 5 in the old testement so we will need to use this speaker tagging.
As a first goal we would aim to extract the explicitly stated relationships, like in genesis 5.
We all felt that this project would engage us and would be a great problem to solve so we would really enjoy having this for our project.

## Backups
- QA system about CSSE

- CPE departments Artificial CSC Student

## Data Plan
We can gather publicly available novels to train and test our model. In addition, we may have to 

## Preliminary Tools and Libraries
Spacy to extract tagging depencies and etc.
A ML model, yet to be determined.
